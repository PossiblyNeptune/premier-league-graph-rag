## 📖 Overview

This project implements a **Graph RAG** system specialized in Premier League football knowledge, based on two comprehensive books:
- **"The Mixer"** by Michael Cox (Tactics & Strategy)
- **"The Club"** by Robinson & Clegg (Business & History)

### Why Graph RAG?

Traditional RAG systems use only vector similarity search, which can miss related information that isn't semantically similar but is conceptually connected. **Graph RAG** solves this by:

1. **Building a Knowledge Graph** - Document chunks become nodes, relationships become weighted edges
2. **Intelligent Traversal** - Starting from vector-retrieved chunks, traverse the graph to discover connected concepts
3. **Comprehensive Context** - Accumulates rich context from multiple related sources

**Result:** More complete and nuanced answers by discovering information through relationships, not just similarity.

## 🌟 Key Features

- ⚡ **Hybrid Retrieval** - Combines FAISS vector search with graph traversal
- 🏈 **Football-Optimized** - Custom preprocessing for tactics, formations, and entities
- 🧠 **Local LLM** - Runs Ollama locally (no API costs, complete privacy)
- 📊 **Full Observability** - Detailed logging of retrieval decisions and graph traversal
- 🎯 **Query Classification** - Adapts retrieval strategy based on query type
- 💬 **Interactive UI** - Beautiful Streamlit interface with debug mode

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Document Processing

**Chunking Strategy:**
- Size: 1500 characters (~250 words)
- Overlap: 250 characters (~40 words)
- Method: Recursive splitting (paragraphs → sentences → words)

**Domain Preprocessing:**
- Normalize formations (4-4-2, 433, 4/4/2 → 4-4-2)
- Expand abbreviations (CDM → defensive midfielder)
- Extract tactical entities (pressing, false nine, etc.)
- Recognize key figures (Wenger, Ferguson, etc.)

### 2. Knowledge Graph Construction

**Node Creation:**
- Each chunk becomes a node
- Metadata: source file, page, concepts, formations

**Edge Creation:**
- Connect nodes with cosine similarity > 0.7
- Weight formula: `0.7 × similarity + 0.3 × concept_overlap`

### 3. Query Processing

**Step 1: Classification**
- Categorize query (manager, tactics, player, business, etc.)
- Adjust retrieval parameters based on type

**Step 2: Enrichment**
- Add contextual keywords
- Example: "Wenger" → "Wenger Arsene Wenger Arsenal manager..."

**Step 3: Vector Retrieval**
- FAISS finds k-nearest chunks (k=8-12 based on query type)
- Uses HuggingFace embeddings (384-dim)

**Step 4: Graph Traversal**
- Modified Dijkstra's algorithm
- Start from retrieved chunks
- Traverse weighted edges to discover related nodes
- Apply depth penalty to encourage breadth
- Stop at 20 nodes or 4000 characters

**Step 5: Answer Generation**
- Combine accumulated context
- Add type-specific guidance
- Generate with Ollama (temperature=0 for determinism)

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Embedding Model

**Model:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Dimensions: 384
- Architecture: Distilled BERT (6 layers)
- Training: Contrastive learning on sentence pairs
- Performance: 0.81 Pearson correlation on STS benchmark
- Speed: ~2000 sentences/sec on CPU

### Graph Traversal Algorithm

**Modified Dijkstra:**
```python
distance = (current_priority + 1/adjusted_weight) × depth_penalty

where:
  adjusted_weight = 0.7 × edge_weight + 0.3 × concept_relevance
  depth_penalty = 1.0 + 0.05 × depth
```

**Intuition:**
- Prioritizes strong relationships (high edge weights)
- Balances semantic similarity with concept overlap
- Depth penalty prevents going too deep in one path

### Edge Weight Calculation

```python
edge_weight = α × similarity_score + β × normalized_shared_concepts

where:
  α = 0.7 (semantic similarity weight)
  β = 0.3 (concept overlap weight)
  normalized_shared_concepts = |shared| / min(|concepts₁|, |concepts₂|)
```
